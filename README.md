# Cracking `java.util.Random`

This is a very simple program demonstrating how easy it is to predict the output of the `java.util.Random` class.  
I take zero credit for this; the code was lifted and adapted from this blog entry and its comments:

This program works successfully in Java 8, and I believe also in Java 7 but I haven't checked.  I'm pretty certain it
won't work on Java 6.
